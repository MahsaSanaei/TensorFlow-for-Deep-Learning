# TensorFlow-for-Deep-Learning
This repository is a collection of TensorFlow for Deep Learning course code that I have attended the online course https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187 on Udacity.<br/>
In this course we learn how to build deep learning applications with TensorFlow. We get hands-on experience building our own state-of-the-art image classifiers and other deep learning models. Finally, We use advanced techniques and algorithms to work with large datasets.
